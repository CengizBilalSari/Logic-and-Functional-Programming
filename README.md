This repository contains the projects and related materials for the CMPE 260 Principles of Programming Languages course.

## **Project 1: Farm Management with Prolog**
This project involves developing a simulation for a farm environment where animals can move around, consume food, and reproduce.
The simulation is set in a simplified, farm-themed world where reaching sufficient energy points from foods allows animals to reproduce.
The farm.txt and smallfarm.txt files are given for example usage.
## **Project 2: Memory Management Unit with Scheme**
The project centers around the creation of a simulation for a Memory Management Unit (MMU). In computing, an MMU is a hardware component that plays a crucial role in the operation of modern computer systems. 
It acts as a mediator between the Central Processing Unit (CPU) and the main memory, translating logical addresses generated by the CPU into physical addresses that can be used to
access data and instructions stored in memory.
